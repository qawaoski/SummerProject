Introduction:
Manager assigns various tasks and employees are supposed to report to manager. It is not convenient for manager to maintain record/ keep account of work done by everyone every day. So to maintain the transparency and work done by everyone, this software was developed. But not only just tracking the work, this software has additional functionalities and is being continuously improvised as per the needs and requirements of the organization.
It has different features and functionalities for:
admin (manager)
employee (senior/junior)
Admin can add new employees, delete/ remove employees, view all employees, assign tasks to employees and view all tasks. He has access to the master database.
An employee can do task registration, task completion, view all tasks. And apart from this, a senior employee can assign a task to his/ her junior. 
It also has file upload feature where any file type can be uploaded. Also, the task register and completion time is stored as system time to avoid false data entry by users.
It is consistently being improvised to add more features like email notifications to employees, links for file access, change password feature, etc.
